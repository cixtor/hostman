### Hostman (Hosts Manager)

Hosts manager with focus on simplicity and support for adword blocker lists. You can add, remove, disable, enable entries in the hosts file; works better with _dnsmasq_ for advanced control of the DNS A record connections and implicit configuration for wildcard domains.

The hosts file is a computer file used by an operating system to map hostnames to IP addresses. The hosts file is a plain text file, and is conventionally named hosts. The DNS implementation automated the publication process and provided instantaneous and dynamic hostname resolution in the rapidly growing network. In modern operating systems, the hosts file remains an alternative name resolution mechanism, configurable often as part of facilities such as the _Name Service Switch_ as either the primary method or as a fallback method.

In some operating systems, the contents of the hosts file is used preferentially to other name resolution methods, such as the DNS, but many systems implement name service switches to provide customization. Unlike remote DNS resolvers, the hosts file is under the direct control of the local computer's administrator.
